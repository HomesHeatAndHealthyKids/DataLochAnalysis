        "This code is going to build up a list of condition codes and their mappings to phenotypes. The list will serves a couple of purposes:\n",
        "1. **Lookup** - map ICD10 or Read V2 code to description of code\n",
        "2. **Categorisation** - convert ICD10 or Read V2 code to a condition/phenotype\n",
        "\n",
        "The list will combine the 22 chronic conditions investigated by Swann et al in a set of Harmonised Code Lists with a list of conditions taken from the DataLoch contract. Some of these lists will be constructed manually from the DataLoch contract. Others will be constructed directly from the [HDR UK Phenotype library](https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/). The Harmonised Code Lists are stored in the HDR UK Phenotype library. The [pyconceptlibrary](https://swanseauniversitymedical.github.io/pyconceptlibraryclient/collections/) can be used to download phenotypes from the HDR UK phenotype library.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resultant data will be reduced to several columns:\n",
        "*   **phenotype_category** - ideally, any given code will only appear once in a given phenotype_category. There are two categories - \"Chronic Paediatric Conditions\" and \"Acute Respiratory Infections\"\n",
        "*   **code** - ICD10 or Read V2 code\n",
        "*   **description** - long description of the code\n",
        "*   **code_system** - indicates whether the code is ICD10 or Read V2\n",
        "*   **clinical_subcategory** - subgrouping of phenotype codes (e.g. gastrointestinal device or gastrointestinal condition)\n",
        "*  **phenotype_name** - name of the condition\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, I will compare these lists to the lists used for Eleanor's Dissertation.\n",

        "\n",

These lists have been \"harmonised\" to include Read V2 codes, ICD10 codes, and SNOMED codes. The SNOMED codes will be filtered out as these are currently unused in Scotland.\n",

For example, a Read V2 code would not be replicated across different phenotypes with the \"Chronic conditions\" category. Unfortunately, there are a significant number (289) of rows that appear more than once in the chronic conditions. This seems to particularly impact the diabetes diagnoses, but other conditions are also impacted."
